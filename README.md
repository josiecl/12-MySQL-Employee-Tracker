## Description
This project allows the user to add/view departments, roles, and employees, and also allows the user to update an existing employee's role. It utilizes MySQL to save information to a database, and to connect the tables for  departments, roles, and employees.

## Usage
In order to use, the user should download the files. They should then run 'npm i', which will install necessary dependencies, and they should also input their MySQL data into a .env file. This information should correspond with the  called info at the top of the index.js file. The user should also ensure the database is created properly in MySQL. The user can then use the terminal to run 'node index.js', which will call up the menu to be used.
